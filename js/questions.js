In order to select the for loop that actually produces                         the correct result, we must first of all revisit its                          structural elements. In PHP, for loops are declared                          as follows:<br/><br/>                          &nbsp;&nbsp; for(&lt;init statement&gt;; &lt;continue until statement&gt;; &lt;iteration statement&gt;)<br/><br/>                         where the &lt;init statement&gt; is executed prior to                          entering the loop. The for loop then begins executing                          the code within its code block until the                          &lt;continue until&gt; statement evaluates to False.                          Every time an iteration of the loop is completed, the                          &lt;iteration statement&gt; is executed. Applying                          this to our code segment, the correct for statement                          is:<br/><br/>                         &nbsp;&nbsp; for($idx = 1; $idx < STOP_AT; $idx *= 2) <br/><br/>                         or answer C","isexamquestion":"1"},{"num":"12","question":"Choose the the appropriate function declaration for                       the user-defined function is_leap().

If you needed a function to modify                          the array's contents, you'd have no choice but to                          pass it by refernce - but that's not the case here.
